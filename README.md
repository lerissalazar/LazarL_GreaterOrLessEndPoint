Open up the program, run it by pressing f5. Then copy the URL and paste it into postman, add in the Controller name and the Route name ("GreaterLessGreatOrLess/{num1}/{num2}"). 
Enter two numbers into the url and the computer will say if its < ,> or =

peer review: Pedro Castaneda - I really like the clean code! The only thing I would try adding is some validatoin. But other than the your program works great! Nice job.
